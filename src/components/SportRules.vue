    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>Surfers perform manoeuvers and tricks on a wave that are scored by five judges based on the variety, type and difficulty of the tricks. Surfers are also judged on their speed, power and flow (the way in which a surfer seamlessly connects their moves from one to the next). Shortboards are the surfboards of choice for the Olympics. Smaller than longboards, shortboards are faster and more manoeuvrable, which makes them the ideal board for performing spectacular tricks.</p>
