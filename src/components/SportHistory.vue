    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>In the 1920s, surfing fans including three-time Olympic swimming freestyle champion and native Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku began campaigning for the sport to be added to the Olympic programme. Many years later, surfing finally made it onto the Olympic programme for the Tokyo 2020 Games, and will return for Paris 2024; the legendary surfing spot Teahupoâ€™o in Tahiti has been selected as the venue for the surfing competition.</p>
